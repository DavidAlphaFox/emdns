emdns is a cleverly named implementation of the multicast DNS (aka
Bonjour, aka ZeroConf) and DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) protocols
for Erlang.

Eventually, it will support:

BUILD

QUICK START

Assume you have two hosts "nul" and "ack". Any multicast DNS services
are disabled on "nul". "ack" runs Mac OS X.

Host Entry

1. Login to "ack". From a shell, run:

$ ping nul.local
ping: unknown host nul.local

2. On "nul", start erl:

$ erl -pa ebin
> emdns_server:start().
{ok,<0.35.0>}
> emdns_server:debug(true).
ok
> A = emdns:service(host). % assumes "nul" has a reverse DNS entry
<<0,0,132,...>>
> emdns_server:send(A).
ok

3. On "ack", run:

$ ping nul.local
PING nul.local (192.168.1.10): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=4.471 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.611 ms

4. Set up a DAAP service 

> D = emdns:service(daap).
> emdns_server:send(D).

5. On "ack", in iTunes, check "Devices" for a entry named "erlMOTE".
